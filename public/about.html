<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
    Hi! I'm Anis A'thiqah, but you can just call me Anis. I'm from the beautiful country of Malaysia, currently in my final year at Universiti Teknologi Petronas (UTP). Right now, I’m interning at IBM Malaysia, where I’m part of the Finance Robotic Process Automation (RPA) team, learning about cutting-edge tech and automation. </p>

    When it comes to food, I’m open to trying anything, but I do have a favorite drink—Chagee! It’s a popular tea brand from Taiwan that has found a special place in Malaysia’s heart. As for family, I have one younger brother who's navigating the fun chaos of high school.
    </p>
    Looking ahead, I'm aiming to pursue my master’s at MIT or perhaps in the historical charm of Edinburgh. I can’t wait to see where my journey takes me!</p>
